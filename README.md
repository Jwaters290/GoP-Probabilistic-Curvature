1. Background

In the Gravity of Probability framework, the total stress–energy tensor is written as:

Tᵤₙᵤᵗᵒᵗᵃˡ = Tᵤₙᵤ + Tᵤₙᵤᵖʳᵒᵇ

where:

Tᵤₙᵤ is the classical stress–energy (baryons, radiation, etc.)

Tᵤₙᵤᵖʳᵒᵇ encodes a small but non-negligible curvature contribution from unrealized quantum amplitudes, modulated by decoherence and entropy

For a homogeneous fluid, we can approximate:

Tᵤₙᵤᵖʳᵒᵇ ≈ κA · Γ(E) · ρ_ψ

where:

κA is the global amplitude that sets the overall strength of the probabilistic curvature

Γ(E) is the decoherence kernel, implemented as a bell-curve function in energy

ρ_ψ is the effective probabilistic or entanglement density, which follows the baryonic (normal-matter) distribution and is scaled by the entanglement fraction f_ent

This repository exposes those ingredients in a simple Python API so that
collaborations (e.g. DESI, Euclid, JWST, lensing groups) can plug GoP into
their existing pipelines.

#  VAC Phasing & Falsifiability Roadmap

This repository is designed to be forward-compatible with upcoming DESI Value-Added Catalogs (VACs).  
The Gravity of Probability (GoP) framework is **explicitly falsifiable** and makes predictions *before* the relevant VACs exist.

### Phase I — Lyα / LSS Power Spectrum (Q1–Q2 2026)

As DESI releases Lyα forest and early large-scale structure VACs, GoP predicts a specific, small but coherent deviation from ΛCDM in the linear matter power spectrum.

At redshift z ≈ 2.2–2.8, GoP predicts:

**Prediction:** DeltaP/P ≈ 0.02–0.04 for k ≈ 0.1 h/Mpc

where

**Definition:** DeltaP(k) = P_GoP(k) – P_LCDM(k)

Key properties:

- The effect is **sign-fixed** and **scale-localized** (around \( k \sim 0.1\, h/\mathrm{Mpc} \)).
- It arises from **decoherence-driven probabilistic curvature**, not bias or nuisance parameters.
- It is **not** predicted by standard ΛCDM or MOND.

This repo includes a ready-to-run test script:

- `scripts/gop_lss_earlytest.py`  
  - Ingests DESI Lyα / LSS VAC power spectra  
  - Compares against GoP predictions  
  - Computes and plots ΔP/P around k ≈ 0.1 h/Mpc


Once the relevant VACs are public, the Phase I test is essentially:

> “Does DESI see a 2–4% systematic tilt at k ≈ 0.1 h/Mpc consistent with GoP, or not?”

### Phase II — Void Stacking & Warm Cores (Post–Year 1 unblinding, 2026+)

Full 3D void stacks, BAO-reconstructed density fields, and thermal / kSZ-like maps enable GoP’s primary “kill-shot” test:

- **Warm cores in cosmic voids**
- **Redshift-dependent thermal peaks in void interiors**
- **Residual curvature consistent with probabilistic stress–energy, without dark matter**

GoP predicts that properly stacked voids exhibit:

1. A **central warming** (relative to ΛCDM expectations) consistent with decoherence-weighted curvature.
2. A **preferred redshift band** for maximal warm-core signal.
3. A **residual lensing / curvature signature** that cannot be mimicked by halo bias or baryonic feedback alone.

Phase II uses:

- `notebooks/gop_void_warmcore_template.ipynb`  
  – placeholder analysis for:
  - ingesting DESI void VACs  
  - stacking voids in bins of radius and redshift  
  - measuring thermal / curvature residuals  
  - comparing to GoP predictions

### Philosophy

This repository is built around a simple principle:

> **Predictions first, data later.**  

All GoP constraints against DESI VACs are pre-registered here in code and documentation, so that validation or falsification can be checked immediately when the VACs become public.

## Running the Early Lyα / LSS GoP Test (Developer Note)


When the DESI Lyα / LSS Value-Added Catalog (VAC) becomes publicly available, you can test the GoP prediction directly using:

```bash
python scripts/gop_lss_earlytest.py \
    --pk-file path/to/desi_pk_vac.dat \
    --plot-out plots/delta_pk_gop.png
```

This will:

load the DESI P(k) measurement

compute ΔP/P

generate a plot of the GoP prediction around k ≈ 0.1 h/Mpc

Switching from the Toy Model to the Real GoP P(k) Prediction

The script contains a placeholder “toy” gop_predict_pk function.
Once the GoP cosmology module is installed, replace that function with:
```bash
from gop_cosmology import compute_pk_gop

def gop_predict_pk(k_array, cosmo_params=None):
    return compute_pk_gop(k_array, **(cosmo_params or {}))
```
This connects the test script directly to the real GoP cosmology pipeline so the P(k) comparison is physically meaningful when DESI VAC data is available.

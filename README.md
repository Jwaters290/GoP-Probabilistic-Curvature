# GoP-DESI-VACs-Pipeline-And-Testbed

This repository provides the **reference implementation** of the [Gravity of Probability (GoP)](https://figshare.com/articles/thesis/The_Gravity_of_Probability/29815934)
probabilistic curvature framework and its associated prediction pipelines.

It implements the **probabilistic stress–energy contribution**:

T_prob(μν)

arising from quantum decoherence and entanglement, and provides tools for
galaxy dynamics, gravitational lensing, and large-scale structure tests.

## Included Components

- Canonical decoherence kernel Γ(E)
- Global GoP constants (fixed, pre-registered)
- Probabilistic stress–energy tensor tools
- Warm-core and cosmic void predictions
- Rotation curve and lensing utilities
- DESI / Euclid large-scale structure test scripts

This is the **official codebase** used for GoP predictions in cosmology and LSS analyses.

# DESI Warm-Core Prediction Script

### File: `gop_warm_core_desipipeline.py` (repo root)

This script implements the GoP warm-core prediction using the fixed July 2025 parameter set:

- kappaA = 1.5e-15  
- E0_erg = 1e12  
- f_ent = 0.20  
- A_CP = 0.0245  

The script computes:

- Baryonic density profile ρ_b(r)
- Probabilistic density contribution ρ_prob(r)
- Effective density ρ_eff(r)
- Inner density slope (cusp vs. core)
- Warm-core enhancement factor
- Diagnostic plots compatible with DESI stacked void analyses

Run the script:

```bash
python gop_warm_core_desipipeline.py
```

## Execution Modes (Important)

The pipeline supports **two explicit execution modes**, serving different purposes.

### 1. Normalized Mode (Default – Template / Overlay Mode)

This mode rescales the local energy proxy so that the decoherence kernel Γ(E)
activates visibly. It is intended for:

- Demonstrating the warm-core *shape*
- Pipeline verification
- Overlaying predicted profiles on DESI stacked void maps
- Figure generation for preregistered predictions

This mode **does not claim physical unit normalization** and is explicitly a
shape-demonstration mapping.

Run:

```bash
python gop_warm_core_desipipeline.py --mode normalized --debug
```


Expected output:

 - Inner slope transitions from cusp-like (≈ −1) to core-like (≈ 0)
 - Strong central warm-core enhancement
 - Diagnostic confirmation that Γ(E) and ρ_prob are non-zero
 - Saved plots labeled by execution mode


### 2. Physical Mode (Dimensionally Consistent)

This mode uses a physically motivated energy density mapping:

E_local ∝ ρ_b · c² · L_coh³

It is intended for production-level modeling, once physical density units
and coherence-scale assumptions are fixed.

By default, effects may be small unless realistic densities and/or large
coherence scales are supplied.

Run:
```
python gop_warm_core_desipipeline.py --mode physical --Lcoh-cm 1e18 --debug

```
This mode preserves unit consistency and should be used when connecting to
fully physical cosmological pipelines.

## Vacuum Stability & Λ_eff Consistency

A **companion repository** numerically verifies the stability of the effective vacuum energy
produced by the GoP decoherence kernel:

- https://github.com/Jwaters290/GoP-vs-Lambda-Vacuum-Constant

This test demonstrates that the canonical kernel

Γ(E) = κA · E · exp(1 − E / E₀)

**naturally saturates**, producing a stable effective cosmological constant Λ_eff under
cosmological conditions.

# Why vacuum energy matching is a non-negotiable requirement

In GoP, vacuum energy is not an auxiliary quantity. It is foundational.

 - GoP asserts that information density and decoherence flow contribute to gravitational curvature.
 - The vacuum is the maximal information reservoir in the theory
 - Therefore, its effective gravitational weight must be reproduced correctly using the same parameters

If GoP failed to reproduce the observed vacuum energy scale, the framework would collapse immediately — not later, immediately.

There is no “patch” available.

So the fact that it lands near 1:1 is not cosmetic; it is existence-level validation.

Most approaches treat vacuum energy in one of three unsatisfactory ways:

 - Cancel it by hand (Λ problem avoidance)
 - Renormalize it away (formal but physically empty)
 - Declare it anthropic (landscape reasoning)

The GoP framework does none of these, it is doing something far stricter:

 - The vacuum has weight because it carries unrealized quantum probability, and that weight must match observation under the same bookkeeping rules that govern galaxies and voids.

That is a single-source requirement.

Very few frameworks even attempt this, but here there's a match.


### Key Results

- No overproduction of vacuum energy
- Rapid convergence to a constant Λ_eff
- Stability under extreme energy distributions
- Compatibility with late-time acceleration
- No fine-tuning required

Consistency is demonstrated relative to:

- Planck CMB ΛCDM parameters
- DESI BAO expansion history
- Type Ia supernova luminosity distances

This validates GoP as a **dark-matter-free curvature model that remains cosmologically viable**.

## GoP Predictions for DESI DR2 (Pre-Registered)

All predictions below are based on a **single fixed global parameter set** (no tuning):

- Warm-core cosmic void temperature imprint: ΔT ≈ 8–12 μK
- Void redshift peak: z ≈ 0.55
- Suppressed clustering amplitude: S₈ ≈ 0.76–0.79
- Dipole amplification factor: 1.2×–1.5×
- BAO peak smoothing / broadening
- H(z) crossover near z ≈ 0.45–0.55
- Tracer independence (BGS, LRG, ELG, QSO voids)

## Background: Probabilistic Curvature

The GoP framework modifies the total stress–energy tensor:

T_total(μν) = T_classical(μν) + T_prob(μν)

Where:

- T_classical represents standard matter and radiation
- T_prob arises from decoherence-weighted quantum probability curvature

Canonical form:

T_prob(μν) ∝ Γ(E) · ρ_Ψ

Where:

- Γ(E) is the GoP decoherence kernel (includes κA by convention)
- ρ_Ψ is the entanglement-weighted baryonic density

All global parameters are **fixed prior to DESI DR2 analysis**.

## VAC Phasing & Falsifiability Roadmap

Phase I — Lyman-Alpha / LSS Power Spectrum (2026)

Prediction:
ΔP/P ≈ 0.02–0.04 at k ≈ 0.1 h/Mpc

Run:
```bash
python scripts/gop_lss_earlytest.py --pk-file desi_pk.dat
```
Phase II — Void Stacking (Primary Test)

DESI stacked voids should show:

- warm central region
- redshift peak at z ≈ 0.55
- curvature residual matching GoP predictions

Run (template mode for overlays):
```bash
python gop_warm_core_desipipeline.py --mode normalized
```

---

## Developer Note: Switching to Full GoP P(k)
The default LSS test uses a Gaussian modifier for early testing.
To switch to the full GoP cosmology:
```
from gop_core.gop_cosmology import compute_pk_gop

def gop_predict_modifier(k_array, cosmo=None):
    return compute_pk_gop(k_array, **(cosmo or {}))

```
This upgrades the script to the full GoP cosmology.

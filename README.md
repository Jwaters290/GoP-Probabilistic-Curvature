# GoP-Decoherence-Driven-Curvature

This repository provides the reference implementation of the Gravity of Probability (GoP)
probabilistic curvature term `T_prob(mu,nu)`.

Includes:

- decoherence kernel `Gamma(E)`
- global GoP constants
- probabilistic stress-energy tools
- warm-core and void predictions
- rotation curve and lensing utilities
- DESI / Euclid test scripts

This is the official codebase used for GoP predictions in cosmology and large-scale structure.

# DESI Warm-Core Prediction Script

### File: `gop_warm_core_desipipeline.py`

This script implements the GoP warm-core prediction using the fixed July 2025 parameter set:

- kappaA = 1.5e-15  
- E0_erg = 1e12  
- f_ent = 0.20  
- A_CP = 0.0245  

It computes:

- baryonic density profile rho_b(r)
- probabilistic density rho_prob(r)
- effective density rho_eff(r)
- inner density slope (cusp vs. core)
- warm-core enhancement factor
- diagnostic plots compatible with DESI stacked void maps

Run the script:

```bash
python gop_warm_core_desipipeline.py
```
Expected (pre-registered):

- inner slope changes from approx. -1 (cusp) to approx. 0 (core)
- warm inner profile
- radial warm-core structure matching DESI DR2 VAC predictions

## Vacuum Stability Test (Λ_eff Consistency Check)

Importantly, in a repo that works parallel to this one, contains the numerical test verifying the constancy and stability of the effective vacuum energy produced by 
the GoP decoherence kernel. It demonstrates that Γ(E) saturates and stabilizes Λ_eff under cosmological conditions, consistent with observations.

The Gravity of Probability (GoP) framework produces a constant effective vacuum energy:

Λ_eff,

arising directly from the decoherence kernel:

Γ(𝐸)=𝜅𝐴*𝐸𝑒^−𝐸/𝐸0

This simulation demonstrates that probabilistic curvature naturally saturates to a stable vacuum state, even under extreme variations in the local energy distribution. This is a crucial internal consistency check showing that:

- GoP does not overproduce vacuum energy

- Λₑff converges rapidly and remains constant

- The decoherence field ρΨ yields a cosmological constant without fine-tuning

- The model remains compatible with late-time acceleration

- The vacuum state is dynamically stable across cosmological scales

This test is essential because any viable alternative to dark matter or modified gravity must also reproduce the observed vacuum energy density, Hubble expansion behavior, and dark-energy-like acceleration without introducing instabilities.

The results here show that GoP’s decoherence-induced curvature produces a self-regulating Λ-term, tightly connected to the scalar field dynamics and entanglement fraction, and consistent with measurements from:

Planck CMB ΛCDM parameters

DESI BAO expansion rates

SN Ia luminosity distances

This repository is part of the broader GoP framework encompassing probabilistic curvature, quantum decoherence cosmology, dark-matter-free rotation curves, strong gravitational lensing predictions, and first-principles cosmological constant generation.

# GoP Predictions for DESI DR2

- Warm-core cosmic void temperature imprint ΔT≈8-12µk
- Void redshift peak at z ≈ 0.55
- S8 suppressed to 0.76 – 0.79
- Dipole amplification factor 1.2x – 1.5x
- BAO peak broadening / smoothing
- H(z) crossover near z = 0.45 – 0.55
- Tracer independence (BGS, LRG, ELG, QSO voids)

All are based on a single fixed global parameter set (no tuning).

# Background

The GoP framework modifies the total stress-energy tensor:

T_total(mu,nu) = T_classical(mu,nu) + T_prob(mu,nu)

Where:

- T_classical is normal matter and radiation
- T_prob is a decoherence-weighted curvature term arising from unrealized quantum amplitudes

Approximate form: T_prob(mu,nu) ≈ kappaA * Gamma(E) * rho_psi

Where:

- kappaA sets amplitude
- Gamma(E) is the GoP decoherence kernel
- rho_psi is the entanglement-weighted baryonic density

The global parameters are fixed prior to DESI DR2:

kappaA = 1.5e-15
E0_erg = 1e12
f_ent = 0.20
A_CP = 0.0245

This repository provides a clean Python API for cosmology and LSS pipelines.

# VAC Phasing & Falsifiability Roadmap

Phase I — Lyman-Alpha / LSS Power Spectrum (2026)

Prediction:
DeltaP/P ≈ 0.02 – 0.04 at k ≈ 0.1 h/Mpc

Run:
```bash
python scripts/gop_lss_earlytest.py --pk-file desi_pk.dat
```
Phase II — Void Stacking (Primary Test)

DESI stacked voids should show:

- warm central region
- redshift peak at ~0.55
- curvature residual matching GoP predictions

Run:
```bash
python gop_warm_core_desipipeline.py
```

---

# Developer Note: Switching to Full GoP P(k)
Change the toy function in gop_lss_earlytest.py to:

```
from gop_cosmology import compute_pk_gop

def gop_predict_pk(k_array, cosmo=None):
    return compute_pk_gop(k_array, **(cosmo or {}))
```
This upgrades the script to the full GoP cosmology.
